<p>I know I'm supposed to release a finished game each month, but this time I only had a day to come up with something.<br />
This is the first time I do something 3D and I invested more time in Blender that I've planned.
</p>
<p>It's puzzle game in 3D where you control some pieces, each one with different effects.<br />
The goal of the game is to take the player piece trough the board avoiding obstacles and reach the other side (the castle).
</p>

<p>I guess I will have to rethink and go back to the original idea: a classic board game with dices.<br />
Maybe I will finish this game sometime later, but for now I just want to forget February and start fresh on March with a new original idea.</p>
<p>If you're morbid curious about the game you can download the apk for Android and take a look.</p>
