		<h2>What is Pathfinding?</h2>

		<p>Often in our games we have NPCs or other entities that need to move from point A to point B in a natural and realistic way. To do that we need to find a path between the two points and then make our character follow that path to solve the problem.</p>
		<p>To get to that solution we need a Pathfinder, an algorithm that processes some data about the terrain and the two points and output a path for us to follow. That algorithm can be implemented using several aproaches: Dijkstra, A-star or the sample algorithm for tile-based navigation.</p>
		<p>In Godot we have two main classes that will help with this problem: Navigation &amp; NavigationMesh (3D) and Navigation2D &amp; NavigationPolygon (2D)</p>

		<h2>Navigation in Godot</h2>

		<p>For this tutorial we are going to focus only on 2D but you can easily use the same aproach for 3D as well. Also there's another aproach at creating a navigable terrain by using tilemaps.</p>
		<p>That said, suppose we have this portion of a map that the character needs to navigate.</p>
