I"k<p>This is a test project I made to learn and familiarize with the development in <strong><a href="http://www.godotengine.org/">Godot Engine</a></strong>.
It is a simple game where the player bounces elements above the head.<br />
It took me about 10 hours realtime inside Godot and about the double for the assets ( Iâ€™m not a art person :) )
