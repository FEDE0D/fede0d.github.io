<blockquote>How do you pass the time when you're going to the bathroom? Play a game perhaps?<br>
	Why don't you waste some paper?<br>
	<br>
	Take it with you wherever you go (<span class="text-muted">*cough*</span> toilet <span class="text-muted">*cough*</span>) and try to beat the highscore every time!<br>
	<br>
	Features a never ending loop of wasted time.<br>
	Now with more paper rolls!
