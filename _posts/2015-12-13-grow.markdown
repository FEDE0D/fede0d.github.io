<blockquote>Endless mazes! Run against the clock and find the exit.</blockquote>

<p>
	A seed has sprouted in the deep. Guide the plant trough the deep mazes and out to the bright light of the sun.<br>
	You have to find the exit before the plant dies.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Oxigen</b>: find the exit before the sprout suffocates.<br>
	<b>Nutrients</b>: eat bugs and rats to stay strong.<br>
	You can make tiny and simple mazes or enormous and harder.<br>

<p>
	I've been making games for <a href="http://onegameamonth.com/">#1GAM</a> for a time now. Some months I've missed the competition, other months I've quit or I couldn't even finish the game in time.
	<br>
	I wanted so much but I didn't have the time to participate in the past Ludum Date, the #33. So this time I did the LD compo.
</p>
<p>
	It was hard.<br>
	The first hour I came up with several game ideas that suited the theme: <b>TWO BUTTON CONTROLS</b> &amp; <b>GROWING</b>.<br>
	Many of that ideas where discarded immediatly as they where too ambitious, too big to make it into 48hs.<br>
</p>
<p>
	Then I came up with the idea of the maze and the seed growing underground looking for the sunlight.<br>
<p class="text-center">...</p>
<p>
	6 hours later I already wanted to quit: there was no gameplay. There was no fun in the game.
	I started up all again from the idea sketeches but none where working.
</p>
<p>
	Long story short: <i>I started all over again 3 times in a row in less than 24 hours.</i><br>
	I've have now 1 completed game (<span class="text-muted">Grow!</span>) and 3 other games in various states of development.
</p>
<p>
	I hope the game was worth the weekend I spend making it.<br>
	And I hope I've learned something good from the experience becouse I'm looking forward to <b>#LD35</b>.
